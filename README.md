# Anagrams

When two words can be rearranged to make a different word using all of the letters from the previous word only once, you have an anagram. For example, 'charm' can be rearranged to spell out 'march'. You get the gist.

## Premise

For this challenge you will make a program that determines if two strings are Anagrams.

## Example
Your program should return true for all the following examples...


```
is_anagram('charm', 'march')
is_anagram('CharM', 'mARcH')
is_anagram('abcde2', 'c2abed')
```
## Remember
Run your test specs early and often. Also, if you come across a scenario that isn't included in your test suite, then you should absolutely add it!

## Challenge Yourself
* Account for anagram phrases.
* Solve this same exercise without using python's built-in `sorted` method.
